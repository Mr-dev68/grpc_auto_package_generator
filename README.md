# Introduction
this is a utility project usefull for C++ devlopers working with grpc and want to automatically build their interfaces. this project can be added as a sub package to a Cmake project or used as standalone app. this cmake project will automatically generate the source and header files plus the static/dynamic libraries from Protocol Buffers proto files.
# pre requirements
following softwares are required: 
grpc
protobuf
protobuf-compiler
cmake

## notes
CMakeLists.txt is well commented and can be adopted to your needs easily.
install_packages is a simple bash script that installs cmake, protobuf and grpc with superuser privileges(root)! (Root access is needed.) It is well commented and can be easily adapted to your needs. 
tested with  following tools versions:
Ubuntu 22.04
cmake 3.29
protobuf 23.4
gRPC 1.57

ccommon.cmake file is taken from https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/cpp/cmake/common.cmake and is from grpc project!

# How to use
easy ! 
1. make sure  all pre requirements are met
2. for each inteface(applciation interface(s)) that you have, create a folder(acts as library name) in protos folder and put your proto file(s) there
3. 
```bash 
mkdir build  && cd build
```
4. 
```bash
cmake .. ( or cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= /install/path)
```
5. make ( or make install) "\n"

this repo already include an "ready to go" example, without touching anything and running install_packages(in a docker container, VN or directly on your system) you will get two sample ready to use grpc interfaces. it will get you the idea how to use it in your projects :D

# using this utility as sub cmake project
if you want to add this as part of your main project follow these steps
1. add the project path to your main cmake.
2. for each application that has dependencies to any grpc interfaces generated by this tool. add the following to its CMakeLists.txt file
    target_link_libraries(${your project name indicated in your cmakelist.txt} gRPC::grpc++   (name of your protos folder)_protobuf )
    add_dependencies(${your project name indicated in your cmakelist.txt} (name of your protos folder)_protobuf)
    example:
    target_link_libraries(test gRPC::grpc++   example1_protobuf )
    add_dependencies(test example1_protobuf)
by this, you make sure before your application is compiled, the Grpc interface it uses will be build and compiled
